Created a website for a friend's restaurant/karaoke bar using react and bootstrap. For the gallery and reservations, I thought about making some backend servers but I wanted the website to be as simple as possible and static so it is easy for my friend to manage. The only part that uses a backend is the contact/email section which uses formspree as the api.
